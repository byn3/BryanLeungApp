    <string name="aboutBryanBodyText">
        \t\tThe bottom of each section will describe major parts and concepts of Android that I have implemented into the current screen.\n\n

        \t\tMy name is Bryan Leung.
        I am self taught and using Android to learn about programming and Java.
        I am a University of California, Santa Cruz graduate.\n\n

        \t\tHow do I learn and what resources do I use?\n
        I use free online resources to learn a bit everyday:
        Udacity, Udemy, Codecademy, Youtube, Blogs, Google/Android developer site, Reddit, Stack Overflow, etc.\n\n

         \t\tWhat do I do in my free time and when I am not studying?\n
        My hobbies. I hike long distances for decent scenic views or for Pokemon Go. Ha!
        That was a semi-joke. I snowboard in the winter.
        I can slow cook ribs over many hours and have the meat just fall off the bone.
        I enjoy making days worth of meal prep.
        I am a heavy gamer, both literally and symbolically.\n\n

        \t\tWhat is my personality like?\n
        My personality or role is not static, but rather dynamic and versatile.
        I can be an introvert support in the back or the extrovert star at head of the team.
        I am a great vacation planner as well as an open-minded and spontaneous person.
        I prefer clean and tidy but will get my hands dirty to do some manual labor if need be.
        I enjoy learning about mostly everything: politics, tech, science, the economy, current events, and local issues.
        For example, my Youtube \"watch it again\" section shows cat videos, anime clips, Primitive Technology\'s videos, Gordon Ramsay cooking,
        fishing videos, physics phenomena, Insider, AGT, and movie trailers. I can watch almost everything and I know what I do not want to watch. \n\n

        \t\tSo what are you doing now?\n
        I paid off my student loans, have no debt, and saved up a lot of money when I was working. I have very, very low spending habits and my financial situation was not dire.
        Because of this lack of urgency I decided to self teach myself programming and here I am.
        I am learning CS every day. I am reading CTCI and learning about
        I also traveled to a few countries, attended weddings, and spent a few months with my ailing grandpa in China.\n\n

        \t\tThis page covers scroll view and nice string aesthetics.
        And because the home activity did not have this bottom description, due to design reasons, I will list it here.
        The home page covers Linear and Relative Layouts as well as onClick() buttons.
        I also show my use of clean code and practiced it in the XML values folder: colors, styles, strings.
        I kept hardcoding to a minimum and I have registered an id for all the views so that methods can act or call them.
        There is also a little welcome toast message that pops up when the app boots up. If you found this app through the Google play store,
        then that means I have learned how to follow the guidelines and publish an app.  As a reminder, this is one of my first personal apps and I am constantly learning.
        Thank you\n

    <string name="hiddenAboutBryanBodyTextPartDos">

        This is all stuff I cut from my original body paragraph but wanted to include it since it still provides more insight but less important, in my opinion.
        I have a B.S. in Human Biology.
        After numerous years of science classes, hospital shadowing, internships, and medical work experience, I am making a career change out of science and health care.
        Now I am focusing on my quarter life crisis, which is a career change into the tech field.

        \t\tWhat am I doing while self teaching?\n
        I have filled the role of a stay at home mom but without the kid or the ring or the female role.
        Yes, that was supposed to be a joke.
        I meal prep for two, act as a six-star personal driver, and take care of highly dependent woman, who is getting her doctorate degree.
        I worked since high school and still have the student work permit to prove my early work ethic.
        I have had numerous other jobs since, mostly in food or customer service to help pay for college.\n\n

        After peaking at 230 pounds, I started exercising more and my goal is to stay sub 200s and healthy.
        I am tough on the outside as well as the inside. Growing up, I was used to being bullied, \"walking it off,\"
        and dealing with life. I run from challenges or struggles. I have my confidence and past to push me through new content ahead of me.

         \t\tDuring college I had many internships in the fields of construction, public health, medical, and education.
        After college I had a job at IHSS, now knows as Homebridge, working as a caregiver.
        I looked after many clients with many different ailments, physical and mental.
        While working, I volunteered, shadowed a orthopedic surgeon, and studied for the MCAT.
        I applied to medical school but am not pursuing that path anymore.
        Looking back, I know that I went in for the wrong reasons and I believe others do deserved it more.
        I am grateful for the many dozens of people who have helped me.
        My volunteer experiences vary from animal shelters, tutoring, and wildlife restoration.

    <string name="entertainingStory">
         \t\t I will now entertain you with a story and how I imagine my life plan:
        While learning Java and Android, I create this decent app that acts like an extremely personal profile page.
        This is my first personal project and programming baby.
        You somehow stumble on this. You are reading this, it impresses you, you like me, and you find me ambitious and driven.
        You also read all my other hidden strings in this file and get to know me even more.
        You want to give me a chance.
        You get me started off with an internship or temporary job at your company.
        Months go by and no one has a problem with me.
        My performance is satisfactory and I am reliable.
        I am responsible, mature, and meet deadlines.
        You agree that my personality is a perfect fit for the company culture.
        Now it is the nearing the end of my trial, I receive an offer.
        I start off as a junior developer and after a few years and an open position, a senior.
        More positions open up that I am interested in.
        I get promoted to team manager or an administration position.
        You have noticed my leadership skills and important inputs after several more years.
        Eventually I am on the board of the company.
        The project that I started on has grown exponentially.
        You retire and at that going away party, you find that I have bought you life time tickets to that thing you love.
        I now reveal to everyone at that party that I will be taking over as Chief Executive (insert alphabet letter).
        Everyone is happy and the company is a success all thanks to you and me.
        Wow that was a great and entertaining story huh?
        A bit dramatized but that makes it more fun which engages you.
        Do you know how hard it is these days to keep people reading?
        Lots of short attention spans, instant gratification behaviors, and lack of intractability in this text string,
        And I still have you hooked and reading =).
        The moral to this story is that I am a decent person and you are interested in me because no one reads this far down
        and is not intrigued.\n

    <string name="phoneIntentEnding">
        \t\tI learned how to start activities in other apps such as the camera or messaging via implicit intents.
        The Bryan app will crash if there are no apps that can receive the intent.
        If you click the last button, you will open an Imgur album of me. I like to make ugly faces and take hideous selfies.
        I also learned about permissions on Android and how API 23+ needs to request on runtime.
        I played around with requesting, handling, and checking permissions code from the Android developer site.
        There were many intermediate concepts and code that I practiced with online but I did not implement those lines of code in this app.
        I kept this app real basic and minimal so I could focus more on studying DS and Algorithms.
        With the camera, I learned about making new files to store the images, accessing with a bitmap, and setting them into an image view.
        The email used is extremely basic and I did not go further into that.
        The maps taught me about uri and the option of using map URLs versus a Google Maps intent for my intended purpose.
        The SMS part gave me the longest issues and hardest problems with permissions and API levels.
        This is where I learned the most and changed my button to instantly send a pre-written string without opening the messaging App.
        The call button just dials my number and the user has to hit dial.
        The internet intent opens a page with a few humorous photos of me and their witty description.

    <string name="socialMediaEnding">
        \t\tThe focus of this activity was to learn about custom spinners and apply that knowledge.
        I followed a tutorial and tweaked parts to fit and to personalize this. I used two xml layouts and 3 Java classes to make this one screen work.
        In the future I should add a button that starts an intent that opens a web browser when the user selects from the spinner.
        I make good use of a for loop and an ArrayListAdapter. but also hard coded many strings in here.
    </string>

    <string name="gamesPlayedEnding">
        \t\tThe main focus of this activity page was to make an ArrayList, custom ArrayAdapter,
        essential java classes for the Adapter, and follow important CS concepts. For example, this page uses view recycling and no loops.
        Initially, I made a while loop for a LinearLayout and that would have been terrible for memory management and scalability.
        If this page had thousands of company names (or other data) it would have taken several seconds to load and run out of memory.
        But by using my Adapter, custom XML layouts, ListView, and recycling, this activity does not and will not strain the device\'s memory.
        I also learned about design regarding the different Android graphic dimensions (LDPI,HDPI,XHDPI, etc) and mipmap icons.
        This page, compared to the Social Media page, practices much better coding practices.

<string name="dreamCompanyToWorkFor">
        \t\t I\'m looking for an opportunity where I can grow.
        Where my boss is respectable, knowledgeable, and well-communicated.
        A workplace where I am a valued asset.
        A company that invests in me and believes in my abilities.
        One that when I look back every year, I can notice my skills as a developer improve.
        A fine work and life balance plus great coworkers.
        Sends me off to conventions, conferences, hackathons, and work related events.
        Puts an emphasis on continued education and the latest tech.
        Has a few company and team bonding events.
        Tasty and healthy food.
        When I am asked- If you could go back in time,
        and do anything you want with your current brain, would you do this again?
        And if I answer yes without hesitation or thought, my dream is complete.
